# Portfolio - First Web Dev University Project

## Description
This was the first website that I created during my time at the university. The task was to create the frontend for a portfolio website containing all of the essential information about myself 
including pictures and videos. The project was a part of my Web Development I course. 
The whole website was created using only vanilla HTML and CSS (with Bootstrap).
